# Solar Command ALPHA

## About

This is mostly to familiarize myself with Phaser 3 and its innards - a simple top-down shooter game.

Might or might not be playable at any point of time.

## Playable version

https://gask13.github.io/sol_cmd_alpha/

## How to run

To run locally, just clone the repo and use

npm install http-server -g

http-server

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080, there will be a simple server running the game.
