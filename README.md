# Solar Command ALPHA

This is mostly to familiarize myself with Phaser 3 and its innards.

Might or might not be playable at any point of time.

To run locally, just clone the repo and use

npm install http-server -g
http-server

Then navigate to http://localhost:8080, there will be a simple server running the game.

All game assets are pulled from https://opengameart.org
